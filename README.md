# AMAZON-SALES-ANALYSIS
Project Overview:
In this project, I performed an end-to-end analysis of Amazon sales data, which included:

▪️ETL Process: Extracting, transforming, and loading data for meaningful analysis.

▪️Exploratory Data Analysis: Uncovering trends and patterns in sales data.📈

▪️Feature Engineering: Creating new features like Year, Month, and Shipping Duration to enrich the dataset.

▪️Predictive Modeling: Building a machine learning model to forecast future sales.

📈 Key Insights and Findings:

▪️Monthly Sales Trends: Identified peak sales months and seasonal patterns.
▪️Yearly Sales Analysis: Observed consistent growth in annual sales revenue.
▪️Year-Month Trends: Combined year and month analysis to pinpoint specific periods of high sales activity.

Profit Margins:
Analyzed profit margins across different regions and product categories to identify the most profitable segments.

Shipping Duration Analysis:
Evaluated average shipping duration by sales channel and order priority.
Found that expedited shipping methods significantly reduced delivery times, improving customer satisfaction.

Predictive Modeling:
Developed a linear regression model to predict future sales.
The model achieved a high R-squared value, indicating strong predictive power.

🔧 Technologies and Tools Used
Data Analysis and Visualization: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn

Dashboarding: Power BI
🛠 Challenges and Solutions

Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values and data inconsistencies to ensure a robust analysis.
Feature Engineering: Created meaningful features to enhance model performance.
Model Evaluation: Iteratively tested and tuned the model to achieve the best results.

📊 Visualizations:
Included detailed visualizations to communicate findings effectively:

▪️Line Charts: For monthly and yearly sales trends.
▪️Bar Graphs: For profit margins and shipping duration.
▪️Pie Charts: For average shipping duration by sales channel.
